# Rockbuster-SQL

This project focused on a film rental company, Rocbuster Stealth, which is a fictional company that previously had stores around the world but faces stiff competition from the streaming giants. 

**Objective**
To help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. The first task was to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then use SQL to analyse the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
